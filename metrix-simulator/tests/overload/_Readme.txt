Tests for overload mode. In overload generators can be used in preventive and curative and 
difference variables can be used.

preventive_with_difference: put a great cost for difference variables to show the use of generators
difference_var: P=C cannot be done due to too much load. In OPF, we have load lost and in overload, difference variables are used
