# powsybl-metrix

This module is based on powsybl-core network modeling and framework.\
It provides two main tools : MappingTool and MetrixTool\
It can also be used as a library to integrate its functionnalities
into java applications.

The MappingTool provide a mapping configuration from csv timeseries to network.
This configuration allows to generate iidm network at specified time. Furthermore,
it allows using the second tool, MetrixTool.

MetrixTool can compute power load flow and optimal power loadflow for the multi variant
networks generated by the mapping tool. Its output are completed by synthesis. 

## Install

Run `./install.sh`

## Usage

`itools mapping` and `itools metrix` are the command line tools that are provided to use and test the mapping and metrix.
Their respective usage is detailed in the following sections.\
For more advanced and intensive usage it is recommended to embedded this package as a library as the time series storage is not optimized.
[Powsybl AFS](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-afs) can be use for that matter.  


### Mapping

itools mapping

### Metrix

itools metrix
