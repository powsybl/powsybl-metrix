[MappingTool](mapping.md) provides a mapping configuration from csv timeseries to network.
This configuration allows to generate iidm network at specified times. Furthermore,
it allows using the second tool, MetrixTool.

[MetrixTool](metrix.md) can compute power load flow and optimal power load flow for the multi variant
networks generated by the mapping tool. Its outputs are completed by synthesis.

MetrixTool calls *[metrix simulator](metrix-simulator.md)* as an external program. This program has its own requirements.
